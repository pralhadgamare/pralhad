	Interface: 			public void type();					WebDriver
						click()
						select()



findElement							

SBI					Edelweiss					BDB 						ShareKhan

T1						T2							T3							T4

type					sendKeys					typeKey					typingKey
click()					click(String Xpath)					






Interface:
-------------


WebDriver is interface & ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver, OperaDriver are classe which implements WebDriver
WebDriver is Parent  & ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver, OperaDriver are child

WebDriver driver=new ChromeDriver()   // Parent p=new Child
 Here driver is Parent type since in run time user might change execution to any browser & my driver should 
 be able to hold object of any browser.

Limitation: Extra Method of ChromeDriver will be get Hide/Masked
 ChromeDriver driver=new ChromeDriver(); // Can you write this ? Yes but It will work on only chrome


What is Maven:
1.It is Project Management Tool which gives Template/Blue print of the Project as below
		src/main/java		> Normal Pojo Classes
		src/main/resources	> Text file, json file, property file,excel file etc. supporting to src/main/java
		src/test/java		> All TestNG/Junit Classes
		src/test/resources	>Text file, json file, property file,excel file etc. supporting to src/test/java

2.It is also known as build management tool: 
		It Manages build creation process. Combining all classes into single unit & converting to machine understanble file

3.It manages all dependancies.
	



Synchronization Problem/AJAX Call:

When there is speed mismatch between 2 things .. Selenium & AUT(OrangeHRM)
To solve this problem
1.Java  Feature: Thread.sleep() //Not Recommended
2.Selenium Feature:
		1.implicit wait
		2.explicit Wait
		3.Fluent Wait


Selenium Waits
1.Implicit Wait  > It takes only Desired time
					> It is global wait (Need to Declare at Once and Applicable till last. 	Aplicable for All Objects )
					>It Waits only for Visibility
					>NosuchElementException

2.WebDriverWait / Explicit Wait
			>Has capability to wait for Visibility, invisibility, text, alert, frame, window etc
			>TimeOutException
			>Polling time/interval of checking 500 ms
		WebDriverWait wt=new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10));  // WebDriverWait 		initilization
		wt.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.linkText("Logout13"))); 

3.FluentWait /Explicit Wait
			>Used When Processing time is going to be taken long
			>Changing Polling Time is available in Fluent Wait
			>You can ignore some kind of Exception
			>TimeOutException is thrown if Object is not found
