How to launch Edge browser in Selenium:
Configuring the Edge Driver
Prerequisites:

Installing the Windows 10 environment on the machine to run tests for legacy versions (15,16,17) of Edge
Downloading accurate WebDriver server version
Ensuring that the updated version of Selenium is being used
Now let’s get started with the steps for configuration.

The primary step is to check the version of the OS build being used. Based on the OS version build, download the corresponding Edge driver.
To check the OS Build, go to Start > Settings > System > About. In the example in this article, OS version build is 17134.
Download the driver for the desired Edge version from the official source as per the OS version build identified earlier. Once the zip file is downloaded, unzip it and copy the .exe file to a specific location.
The next step is to import it in the project file. It’s assumed that the user knows how to set up a basic Selenium project.
One can refer to this article on Selenium with Java to understand how to set-up a basic Selenium with Java project in Eclipse IDE.
Define the Edge driver with its accurate path using the system setProperty method and instantiate the Edge driver.
// Set the driver path
System.setProperty("webdriver.edge.driver", "C://EdgeDriver.exe");

// Start Edge Session
WebDriver driver = new EdgeDriver();

driver.get("https://google.com");

driver.quit();
At this point, the Edge driver has been configured. Now let’s perform a sample test scenario. In this scenario, the code will automate 3 fundamental steps:

Launch the Edge browser
Navigate to the Google website
Enter “BrowserStack Guide” as a search query
Note: To interact with web-elements, one must know how to locate elements in Selenium. Refer to this detailed guide on locators in Selenium to learn about it in detail.

Code for launching Edge Browser using Selenium:

import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.edge.EdgeDriver;


public class Edge_Test{
public static void main(String[] args) {

//Setting system properties of EdgeDriver
System.setProperty("webdriver.edge.driver", "C://EdgeDriver.exe");

//Creating an object of EdgeDriver
WebDriver driver = new EdgeDriver();
driver.manage().window().maximize();

//Deleting all the cookies
driver.manage().deleteAllCookies();

//Specifiying pageLoadTimeout and Implicit wait
driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(40, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

//launching the specified URL
driver.get("https://www.google.com/");

//Locating the elements using name locator for the text box
driver.findElement(By.name("q")).sendKeys("BrowserStack Guide");

// locator for Google search button
WebElement searchIcon = driver.findElement(By.name("btnK"));
searchIcon.click();
}
}
Executing the script above will launch the Edge browser, navigate to the Google website, and enter the term BrowserStack Guide as a search query.
